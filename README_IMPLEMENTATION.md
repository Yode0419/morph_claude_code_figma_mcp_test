## Dummy Data

The app currently uses dummy data with:
- 5 sample tasks across July 1st and July 4th, 2025
- Different task statuses to showcase all UI states
- Sample user with limited reports (3/5 used)

## Running the App

1. Ensure Flutter is installed
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Run `flutter run` to launch the app

## Key Features

1. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
2. **Material Design 3**: Modern UI following latest design guidelines
3. **State Management**: Clean separation of UI and business logic
4. **Dummy Interactions**: 
   - Task action buttons show SnackBar messages
   - Upgrade dialog simulates premium upgrade
   - Calendar navigation works smoothly
   - Date selection updates task list

## Next Steps for Production

1. **API Integration**: Replace dummy data with real API calls
2. **Authentication**: Add user login/logout
3. **Task Management**: Implement actual CRUD operations
4. **Offline Support**: Add local caching
5. **Push Notifications**: Task reminders
6. **Testing**: Add unit, widget, and integration tests
7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states
8. **Accessibility**: Enhanced screen reader support

The implementation successfully recreates the Figma design with pixel-perfect accuracy while maintaining clean, maintainable code architecture.
